	Correct formats
		file1 cmd
		file1 cmd file2
		here_doc LIM cmd file2
		file1 cmd1 cmd2 [cmdn] file2
		here_doc LIM cmd1 cmd2 [cmdn] file2
		file1 cmd1 cmd2 [cmdn] file2 -a
	Incorrect formats
		file1 cmd -a


ISSUES
	For bonus part, -a flag is not required when here_doc is given.
	~ char not handled on path

CASES
	- if no access to in_file
		- 1st command IS NOT EXECUTED
	- if no access to out_file
		- last command is NOT EXECUTED
	- every command in betweem is executed
	*** < file1 > file2 ***
		Means that empty command are accepted.
